# Bias-Mitigation-in-Car-dataset
Created during The IT Girls Bootcamp

This project is created suring The IT Girls Bootcamp with topic Data Science, Storytelling, and Ethics. The bootcamp conducted within 2 days. We practicing how to mitigate biases in a dummy car company dataset which tasked with conducting car crash tests to see whether their newest model is safe enough to enter the market. They have a cutoff of 4 out of 10 for the car model's injury risk rating, which is calculated from 0 to 10. Anything above a 4 will require further testing to ensure the safety of future users. The dataset is accessible in source code file.
